# Process Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This project is a C++ simulation of basic process scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. It aims to demonstrate the fundamental principles of process management, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR) scheduling techniques.

## Current State
As of now, the project is **ongoing**. Initial structures and some basic functionalities have been implemented, but further development and enhancements are in progress.

## Features
- **Process Management**: Basic creation and management of processes.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Processes are handled as they arrive.
  - **Round Robin (RR)**: Processes are managed in a cyclic manner with a fixed time slice.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need a C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang. Follow these steps to compile and run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/basilysf1709/simulator.git
